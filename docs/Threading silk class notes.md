The thread that leads us from the silk industry to modern life ....... 
Technology is not a tech its a social practice like weaving is a social practice.

Louis the 11th extablish the silk industry in lyon. Kings are famously poor. Francois the 1st really wanted people who make improvements to the silk machines and he paid them money. By the 18th century it was 2 mans job, men doing the weaving. There were 30000 people employed weaving to speed up the process.

Jacques de vaucanson. Designed a duck, eat the food, digest the food, excrete the food. Rubberized intestine. Fine mechanical work done in the 18th century. 
One of the invented mechanisms:
He could take one of those mechanisms put it on top and have the teeth almost spring loaded and wrap a card around that so that the teeth will come out at different places. 
Repeating pattern to speed things up. A kid needs to be on top to hold the card in place. The mechanism did not work.

Joseph Marie Jacquard. It took 24000 cards to lift the threads in the right place. The french revolution. counterrevolutionaries one of the monarchs. Jacquard escapes. He becomes a revolutionary.. 1798 return to lyon, pennyless. His father was a weaver and left him a heritage. One of the major consequences of this change is mentality. Cultive rationality changes calender into 10 equal sized month. Promoted scholars to positions of control. What is more rational than the machine.

Napoleon put huge effort into fostering technical innovation scholary innovation. He brings teams of scholars to study egypt. His government spent money on innovation exports such as silk. Jacquard Patent a loom that uses foot pedals. He comes up with a design that uses a square prism. He automates this and replicates the design. You have control of indivdual threads of  silk. Jaquard's loom. It is a one man job.
Punch card was not invented by Jaquard. Louis Falcon
Emergent phenomenon of the social life of lyon. It is not the loom that matters it is the card. replicable, producible and ... the control of the device is seperated from the device itself on a whole other medium. 
Babbage is a dead end: beyond the physical capability of 19th century.
