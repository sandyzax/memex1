project: History of electricity

The eartliest forms of electricity to be experiences by humans were naturally occuring such as lightning and rubbing two objects together. after the scientific revolution, scientists began conducting experiments to study electricity and discovering that electric charges could be positive or negative and that insulated material could prevent the loss of electric charge from a charged object. This has led to the invention of the Leyden jar which allowed electricity to be stored and was used in experiments. Franklin conducted experiments using Leyden jars which allowed humans to understand electricity more. Up to this point, only static electricity was studied and created. Current electricity required the discovery of the battery first before it could be studied. Later when current electricity could be produced and was used in experiments, the connection between electricity and magnetism was discovered. Once they were able to produce current electricity, the discover of the behaviour of a compass needle under an electric current led to the invention of the electromagnet. Faraday's used this discovery to invent the eletric motor and the electric generator. The invention of electric generators and motors enabled the generation of electricty to be economic. Then the use of electricity began to spread around the world.
