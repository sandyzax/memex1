Galvani. History of electricity. forster's body is up for experimentation. The process of galvination. Sense that electricity was there and we knew something about it. It tells us more about the early relationship with science.
Electric charge has the property of amber. It moves from a property to a noun. There is always been a connection between elecricity and life. mguyvur. A way of temporary storing electricity. Laydan Jar.
1746. Another experiment proves that concludes that the electric force can travel and travels instanteously.
1800. Now we can experiment with a constant current than static electricity. 
we can make a telegraph out of this. could i get the needle to point to a letter to move in some kind of code. Michael Faraday. Joseph Henry: He worked out use one path of electricty over to cause a machine to do something over there. If you wore a whole bunch batteries into sequence and introduce circuits. You can send an electrical impulse without loss of its strength. Hnery has just collapsed space time he annilated distance. this is the ancestor of the transistor. 
when humans found out that they could deflect a needle, an electrical current can induce electricity in another electrical current. They immediately went to telegraphy. 
by the 1830s. We have all the pieces in place to introduced the first internet.
