Philip stated even though nobody knows what Gopher is today it helped building a new age as a "user friendly access to a rapidly growing universe of online information". Philip described Gopher as a "go-fer" which a person who fetches things. Gopher retreives data placed on servers that are connected to the internet. It also serves as a router to other internet services. Philip also described Gophers as burrowing mammals, which mirrors the way users tunnel through a digital world using internet Gopher. Gopher users spent hours burrowing through Gopherspace infromation repository. 

According to professional information managers, data has not that much value unless it is organized in a meaningful way. The inventors of internet Gopher developed a software to systematize, arrange, and contextualize data such as documents, audio files and images to add value to the large mass of data available on the internet. This also encouraged other software developers to create softwares for searching and retrieving data quickly, easily and also cheaply. Philip believes that the reason Gopher failed is that it lacked vibrant pictures which is beneficial for advertisements. Commerce is grealty facilitated if the products could be seen by users or customers.
