“de -stream” an article is extracting a reusable piece that can be used in many different things. Making a home page for this idea and a hub to think about this idea. Adding links to this idea from different articles and mentioning the relation between the articles linked and the specific idea. Adding the linking sentence between the articles and the idea to define and understand the relation. Instead of building an argument about the issue, this builds a model of the issue that generates new ways of understanding the idea. Over time this forms a deep network of thoughts and ideas helping the development of new thoughts and understandings. The bridge in the article is defined as the given boundaries and stated purpose. The multi-linear nature of the garden describes the different perspectives and different views of the bridge meaning there is no one right approach. Even though the architect creates the bridge but the visitors are actually the ones who creates the meaning to the bridge. A good bridge is defined as one that support many approaches, views, seasons, uses and overtime the meaning of the bridge will evolve for the architect.
