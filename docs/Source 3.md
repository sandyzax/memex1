Media that is more involved with transmission for example telegraphs rather than representations, offers persuasive representation of text, space, time and human presence in the form code which is sometimes called ‘telepresence’, meaning the feeling that there is someone out there on the other end of the line. The media represent and determine the limits of representation so that new media provide new sites for the ongoing. Media are historical subjects that give a sense of pastness. People learn about the past through media representations such as books, films and “implicit encounters with the past that produced the representation”. The implicit encounters could take any form. It could be a photograph, a visual representation of the moment or subject. It acts as evidence as the photograph was taken in the moment of the past that it represents.
