Luigi Galvani disovered the effects of electricity on muscle tissue the 1780s and 1790s. His assistant accidently touched a scalpel to sciatic nerve of a frog which resulted in a spark and a movement in the frog's legs. Galvani investigated the effects of lightning on frog legs, he discovered a convulsion in the frog's legs when struck by lightning when attached the brass hooks to the spinal cord of the frog to the iron railing the frog's body was suspended from. Galvani replicated the experiment by touching the metal electrodes of brass connected to the frog's spinal cord to an iron plate. This was the discover of "animal electricity" which is the electric power stored in animated living things.
