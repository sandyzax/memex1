Class notes March 6th

- Alan Turing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing
- the desire to systemateize whats going on
- a theory to explain a variation in change
- idea maybe we could put all of mathematics

- what are the series of steps to be taken to solve a problem
- if you can express the problem properly his machine can work on it
- entsheidungsproblem https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/entscheidungsproblem
- the turing machine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine#:~:text=A%20Turing%20machine%20is%20a,of%20implementing%20any%20computer%20algorithm.
- depend of boolean algebra way of expressing logical statements such that its true or false. compute anything that can be computable.

- Shannon again and telephone relays exchnage
- not on the content of the message but its accuracy.....circuits
- if information is quantifiable then it can be measured by shannons
- information can be expressed in bits
- when we combine shannons information theory and his circuits using boolean algebra and turing use of computer. a machine that can simulate any of the work human computer could do.
- Babbage's work used metaphor of the silk industry
- turings machine used punch cards
- babbage' machine no social necessity for it

- emergence of corporation post american civil war changes everything
- tabulators are suitable for the needs of business
- read data and store data
- we dont need computers for business we need them for science
- analogue simulators
- george stibitz (bell labs)
- he builds four subsequent specialized electromechanical calculators
- rendered obsolete in the 1950s
- meanwhile in germany konrad zuse electromechanical binary calculators in 1936
- calculator to speed missile production
- develops the z3 it can store 54 binary digits
- in 1945 zuse flees with the z4 in the back of a truck 
- howard aitken at harvard meets watson. watson agrees to fund aitken. he sees aitken as a way to sell stuff to the navy. aitken social bases doesnt have them. taking pieces of existing technology and wiring it together in a new way. They didnt operate on symbols and they didnt change the programming.

-  Ballistics. The idustrialization of war in the 19th century new types of fireworks new types of guns it depends on air pressure, humidity.  https://webpath.med.utah.edu/TUTORIAL/GUNS/GUNBLST.html#:~:text=The%20term%20ballistics%20refers%20to,Fackler%2C%201996)
- Mauchly and Eniac
- recreates the memo. give him the money. 17000 tubes. 1-.7 billion opporutinity to breakdown in every second. develop the electronic numerical integrator and calculator/computer
- to figure out how to program th thing they have to reverse engineer the whole thing. 
- the role of these women were ignored. How to program this machine in the first place? 
- Grace hopper is working on the level of pulsing electricity and how it works. designs a language. all her algorithems are linear no loops. she doesnt get her name on it. the work that no one valued. push women out. ENIAC women. https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-women-behind-eniac
- encoding memory. wave pulses through vials of mercury. Newman ends up witht he problem not enough computation be done. code break. The need for nuclear simulations drives .....
