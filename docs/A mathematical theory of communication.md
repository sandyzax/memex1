The advantages of logarithmic measures:

- Logarithms are practically useful. Parameters of engineering such as time, bandwidth, number of relays varies proportionally with the logarithm with the number of possibilities. Which means adding one relay to a group doubles the number of possibilities of the outcome. Doubling the time, squares the number of possible outcome thus doubling the logarithm.

- Another advantage is that it is close to our intuitive feeling as well as to the proper measure. For example, intuitivel two punched cards should have double the capacity of one punched card hence storing more information

- A third advantage is that it is mathematically suitable. In terms of logarithms the limiting operations are simple
