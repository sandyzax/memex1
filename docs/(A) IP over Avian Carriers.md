Summary

IP over Avian Carriers (IPoAC) is a joke in computer networking where it proposes birds such as homing pigeons to carry IP traffic. IPoAC has been successfully implemented for nine packets of data and a response time between 3000 seconds to over 6000 seconds. And a packet loss rate of 55% due to operation error. IPoAC suffers from high latency due to the long response time. IPoAC was implemented by Bergen Linux user group in 2001 under the name CPIP (Carrier Pigeon Internet Protocol). Bergen was able to send nine packets over 5 km, each packet was carried by a pigeon and received four responses.

A Gartner report on bird flu that stated "A pandemic wouldn't affect IT systems directly" was criticized for not considering RFC 1149 and RFC 2549. Some of the known risks:
- Carriers being attacked by birds. 
- Carriers blown off course. Storms can lead to data loss.
- Extinction of species such as passenger pigeon
- Carriers being affected by diseases such as H5N1 virus
- "Multicast communications are limited by the homing abilities of carriers"
