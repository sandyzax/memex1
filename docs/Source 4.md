A page is a discrete piece of writing material. ‘The Egyptians, Greeks, Romans arranged text and images into columns called pages’. ‘The conceptual structure of the page was used to organize ideas graphically and then reader developed manual, visual, and cognitive skills to navigate the serial navigation of the scroll’. Writing technology tried to match the dimensions of the physical material with dimensions of pages. This can be seen in rectangular frame of wax tablets and later shown as codex of folio which now is interpreted as the page of a book. The codex played an important role in graphic communication of ideas after the first century. It was extensively used in the medieval and modern periods. Later the codex was an essential tool in the transmission of knowledge. The term page does not only apply to a page in the book. The alternative incarnations of the term page played an important role in the developments of writing technology.
