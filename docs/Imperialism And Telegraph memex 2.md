The speed of communication was restricted to the speed of physical transportation. It had a major social, economical, and political impacts. Armies were able to invade and conquer larger areas of land quickly. Maintaining the unity of empires was challenging back when communication was slow. An enemy threat took weeks, months or even years to reach the imperial capital. In the 19th century, the era of "high imperialism", is when the reliance of communication on physical transportation was broken. This was due to the development electric telegraph, that allowed "real time" communications even with remote parts of the empire. The creation and maintenance of european empires from the late 19th century gained power due to the revolutionary improvements in communication technology. The development of optical telegraph and semaphore systems lead to an increase in speed of communications in the 19th century over medium distances. One of the main limitations of the sephamore system is that it could not be used at night or when the weather is bad.
