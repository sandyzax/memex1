According to the paper, "international communications is not only a business but also a political enterprise". A competition for superiority of great power. British firms almost held monopoly in the 19th century due to the advanced industry in Britain, a wealthy market, and a merchant marine and colonial empire provided to the customers. After the 1880s Britain was faced with an increasing competition from American, German and French firms. After the first World War, radiotelegraphy posed a threat on the dominance of cables. The introduction of shortwave radio almost bankrupted cable companies in the 1930s and the depression also had a great affect on the business. As established by the author of the paper, "every business exists in a political environment". The problem is that businesses with great economic value or strategic importance attracts the government's control. Government's supervision and manipulation turns the business into a political situation. Businesses related to telecommunications is essential to national security and economic prosperity.
