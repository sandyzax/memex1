In the early 1990s, Internet history was shaped and it was a mixture of commercial online services, university networks, and local communit networks that grew to be more commercial and accessible to the public. According to the article, Kevin believes that the origin of the internet traces back to ARPANET, which is the computer network that is created by the Advanced Research Projects Agency during the Cold War. APRANET helps describe the advancing arguments on issues related to censorship, national sovereignty, cybersecurity, privacy, net neutrality, and copyright. However, a big part of history is left out which is the personal blogs, forums and social media platforms that emerged later. Kevin believed that it helped explore how these online communities were developed and maintained. Kevin also mentioned that this provides insight on how to build healthier online communities that are more inclusive.
