The Web is soon going to be controlled by data generated by robotic codes which is going to pollute the infosphere. Data is going to generate more data without any human interaction. Data will not be validated by humans so the validity or accuracy of the data on the internet will not be trusted. Finding human generated data is going to be monetized as it would be a rare incident.
