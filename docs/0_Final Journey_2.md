The goal of this course was successfully met. The approach was completely different than expected.    The roots for the emergence of the internet and the main elements required to create todays internet were introduced. The main elements: a medium to store information, transfer of information from one place to another, the need for communication, automated process. 

- Punch cards [Threading silk class notes]
- interlinking networks
- Cryptology and cryptoanalysis [Cryptology and source 5]
- encoding messages
- Creation of electric current from a magnetic field [Electricity]
- Telegraphy
- Telephone [History and Invention of Telephone]:  transfer sound you could layer frequences hence transmit messages over the wire
- Realization of the effect of political dominance on the history of telegraphy and faxing.
  Headrick stated that "international communications is not only a business but also a political enterprise". A competition for superiority of great power. Headrick argued that the problem is that businesses with great economic value or strategic importance attracts the government's control. Government's supervision and manipulation turns the business into a political situation.

- coding [History of coding]: Realization of that the ENIAC women and Grace hopper are the inventors of modern day coding. Grace hopper worked on the level of pulsing electricity and how it works. She designed a language. All her algorithems were linear no loops. She did not get her name on it. The work that no one valued. ENIAC women were pushed out. https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-women-behind-eniac
- The invention of webbrowsers [(A) Webbrowsers]: 
  Philip stated that the inventors of internet Gopher developed a software to systematize, arrange, and contextualize data such as documents, audio files and images to add value to the large mass of data available on the internet [Gopher].  Creating softwares for searching and retrieving data quickly, easily and also cheaply.

  - Stochastic Parrots [Stochastic Parrots]:
   These models will be trained on their own output
    Encounter stuff on the web that are not human created
    The web is either an inflection point where it is going this echo chambers yelling at other machines. Finding the human is going to be monetized.
