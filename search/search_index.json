There are basic elements of the internet that have stayed the same over the years. The first is the persistence of the internet that led to it being an indestrutable communication network. The second element is \"the development of ruled of communication for computers allowing machines to turn raw data into useful data\". These rules have been developed by computer scientists to facilitate and control online communications and is what helped the development of the internet. A good example is the use of these protocols in Facebook. Facebook allows users to communicate easily with one another as long as the users are follwoing the protocols. The protocols include wall posts, comments and messages. This way facebook control communication.</p>"},{"location":"%28A%29%20Gopher/","title":"(A) Gopher","text":"<p>Source note 4 for memex 3 Date: April 11th 2023 Author: Philip L Frana Reference: Frana, Philip L. 2004. \u201cBefore the Web There Was Gopher.\u201d\u00a0IEEE Annals of the History of Computing\u00a026.1: 20\u201341.\u00a0https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.2004.1278848.</p> <p>Philip stated even though nobody knows what Gopher is today it helped building a new age as a \"user friendly access to a rapidly growing universe of online information\". Philip described Gopher as a \"go-fer\" which a person who fetches things. Gopher retreives data placed on servers that are connected to the internet. It also serves as a router to other internet services. Philip also described Gophers as burrowing mammals, which mirrors the way users tunnel through a digital world using internet Gopher. Gopher users spent hours burrowing through Gopherspace infromation repository. </p> <p>According to professional information managers, data has not that much value unless it is organized in a meaningful way. The inventors of internet Gopher developed a software to systematize, arrange, and contextualize data such as documents, audio files and images to add value to the large mass of data available on the internet. This also encouraged other software developers to create softwares for searching and retrieving data quickly, easily and also cheaply. Philip believes that the reason Gopher failed is that it lacked vibrant pictures which is beneficial for advertisements.

My expectations of this course was way off, I  did not expect this type of approach to understand the invention of the internet and the history behind it. Starting out with the history of silk threading, understanding that silk threading is a social practice which is the basis of the internet. Technology is not a tech its a social practice like weaving is a social practice as mentioned in [Threading silk class notes]. The interlinking networks that was involved in the process of threading silk is the main interlinkage with the idea of the internet. The first approach to an automated machine was by Jacques de vaucanson. He designed a duck that eats the food, digests the food, and excrete the food. In Jaquard's design, what was important is the punch card not the loom itself.  [Wang, Y. (2020). Jacques de Vaucanson (1709\u20131782). In: Ceccarelli, M., Fang, Y. (eds) Distinguished Figures in Mechanism and Machine Science. MESROB 2018. History of Mechanism and Machine Science, vol 38. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32398-1_2]</p> <p>Something replicable, producible and stores information. The idea is that the change in social life of the city of Lyon lead to different paths redgarding silk threading. Which is why Babbage's design failed as it was beyond the physical capability of the 19th century. </p> <p>The history of galvansim also involves the idea of storing information in a medium [Galvanism]. Electricity was temporarily stored in a Layden Jar. Joseph Henry discovered that an electrical current can induce electricity in another electrical current. This was a huge step in communication over distances. Michael Faraday's study about creating an electric field from a magnetic field led to the idea of deflecting a needle to point at some sort of code. This device laid the foundation for large-scale\u00a0electronic communications, as it led to the invention of the telegraph [Galvanism]. From there telegraphy led to the invention of the Atlantic Cable. The historian Gillian Cookson called the Atlantic cable \"The wire that changed the world\". Jorma Ahvenainen stated that \"the global submarine cable network facilitated the very existence of world commerce and world politics\". [M\u00dcLLER, S. M. (2016). From Cabling the Atlantic to Wiring the World] Tully stated that the speed of communication was restricted to the speed of physical transportation [Imperialism And Telegraph memex 2]. Telegraphy had a major social, economical, and political impacts. In the 19th century, the era of \"high imperialism\", is when the reliance of communication on physical transportation was broken. This was due to the development electric telegraph, that allowed \"real time\" communications even with remote parts of the empire. The creation and maintenance of european empires from the late 19th century gained power due to the revolutionary improvements in communication technology.  Tully, J. (2009).

This has led to the invention of the Leyden jar which allowed electricity to be stored and was used in experiments. Franklin conducted experiments using Leyden jars which allowed humans to understand electricity more. Up to this point, only static electricity was studied and created. Current electricity required the discovery of the battery first before it could be studied. Later when current electricity could be produced and was used in experiments, the connection between electricity and magnetism was discovered. Once they were able to produce current electricity, the discover of the behaviour of a compass needle under an electric current led to the invention of the electromagnet. Faraday's used this discovery to invent the eletric motor and the electric generator. The invention of electric generators and motors enabled the generation of electricty to be economic.

A \"telegraph for the people\" would nurture democracy and liberate flow of information strenghtening republic against corporate financiers. Hubbard also worried that what a private company could do with a dominant position controlling the country's vital ciruits of information. A private monopoly over telegraph communications poses a threat on american's democracy. Intercommunications was not evil according to Hubbard but the control of communications should belong to people and is their rights.

After the 1880s Britain was faced with an increasing competition from American, German and French firms. After the first World War, radiotelegraphy posed a threat on the dominance of cables. The introduction of shortwave radio almost bankrupted cable companies in the 1930s and the depression also had a great affect on the business.

In 1866, a durable transatlantic submarine cable was successfully completed which led to a new era of global communication by offering transoceanic communication. Cables were then laid from Europe to India, Southeast Asia, Australia and other far regions. The ocean network kept expanding till it formed dense links with landline connections. And by 1900, 13 Atlantic cables were able to process 10,000 messages daily. Telegraphy is connected to globalization as suggested by the history of wiring the world with atlantic cables. The Atlantic cable prompted cultural, economic, and political changes. It was later concluded that the capabiliites of the Atlantic cable, the services it provided and the products it delivered resulted in radical social changes. The cable changed people's perception of time, distance between countries, and the relationship between nations and continents. Telegraphy did not change people's lives as much as internet and telephone later did, however; it had a radical effect on military, commercial and political activity.
